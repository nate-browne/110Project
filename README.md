### Description

Ever been annoyed by a roommate's erratic schedule, or been locked out with no
way of getting back in and nobody to contact?

RENT can help you manage your rentals by providing tools for shared calendars,
notepads, information about your rental, and emergency contacts so that you and
your roommates can get the most out of renting as hassle free as possible.

Our app is available on mobile for both iOS and Android.

This project was built for Spring 2019 CSE 110 at UCSD with Gary Gillespie over
the course of 10 weeks by the amazing people seen above.
